ECS Components
===================

In a nutshell these are the components of ECS:

    ECS agent:
---------------

        Daemon by amazon used for connecting instances to a cluster.
        If installed, ec2 automatically is attached to default cluster.

    Task Definition:

---------------

        Describes the container(s), volume(s)… of an ECS Service. Task definitions have revisions.
        A Task definition should group containers which share common purpose.
        Task definitions can only have up to 10 container definitions.
        Task definations are written in JSON 

    Service:

----------------

        Used for configuring the amount of tasks definitions desired to be running.
        Defines the scaling and deployment rules for the tasks definitions.
        Used by the ECS Scheduler in order to have the amount of healthy task definitions running.

    Service Scheduler:
---------------------

        Internal service by amazon (hidden for aws users or apis) for managing the cluster.

    Cluster:
---------------------

        It simply holds the elements above.
        Clusters can contain multiple different container instance types.
        Clusters are region-specific.
        Container instances can only be a part of one cluster at a time.
