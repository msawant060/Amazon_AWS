Disaster Recovery RPO and RTO
==================================

RTO
===================

 is the time it takes after a disruption to restore a business process to its service level and RPO acceptable amount of data loss measured in time before the disaster occurs
 
Techniques (RTO & RPO reduces and the Cost goes up as we go down)
=======================================================================

Backup & Restore – Data is backed up and restored, within nothing running
=================

Pilot light – Only minimal critical service like RDS is running and rest of the services can be 
=================
recreated and scaled during recovery

Warm Standby
==================

 – Fully functional site with minimal configuration is available and can be scaled during recovery

Multi-Site
==================

 – Fully functional site with identical configuration is available and processes the load
Services


Region and AZ to launch services across multiple facilities
EC2 instances with the ability to scale and launch across AZs
EBS with Snapshot to recreate volumes in different AZ or region
AMI to quickly launch preconfigured EC2 instances
ELB and Auto Scaling to scale and launch instances across AZs
VPC to create private, isolated section
Elastic IP address as static IP address
ENI with pre allocated Mac Address
Route 53 is highly available and scalable DNS service to distribute traffic across EC2 instances and ELB in different AZs and regions
Direct Connect for speed data transfer (takes time to setup and expensive then VPN)
S3 and Glacier (with RTO of 3-5 hours) provides durable storage
RDS snapshots and Multi AZ support and Read Replicas across regions
DynamoDB with cross region replication
Redshift snapshots to recreate the cluster
Storage Gateway to backup the data in AWS
Import/Export to move large amount of data to AWS (if internet speed is the bottleneck)
CloudFormation, Elastic Beanstalk and Opsworks as orchestration tools for automation and recreate the infrastructure
