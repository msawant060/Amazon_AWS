Storage Gateway
==================

Connects on-prem software appliance with AWS storage to provide seamless & secure between an orgâ€™s on-prem IT environment & AWS storage infrastructure.
Asynch replication backed up to S3 as EBS snapshots
Data is stored within a single region (user specified)
Software appliance is supported on VMware or Hyper-V
3 types of storage gateways:


Gateway Stored Volumes (cloud is backup)
==========================================

Keep entire data set on-prem & asynch backed up to S3
Create storage volumes up to 16TB in size & mount them as iSCSI devices
Used for offsite backups
Constantly replicating changes up to S3 in the form of Amazon EBS snapshots

Gateway Cached Volumes (cloud is primary)
============================================

Only most frequently accessed data is stored on-prem, entire data set is stored in S3
Using S3 as your SAN array
Create storage volumes up to 32TBs in size & mount them as iSCSI devices
If you lose internet access, you lose access to all your data

Gateway Virtual Tape Library (VTL)
============================================

Limitless collection of virtual tapes
Up to 10 virtual tape drives per gateway
Exposes iSCSI interface so populat backup application (Netbackup , Backup Exec, Veeam, ect..) can point directly to VTL
